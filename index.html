        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Problems are solved through creative thinking. I have a habit of direct interaction. Whether I am on stage engaging my audience or seated on my chair solving a problem, I connect in order to relate and that helps me in my approach. Probably because I love doing constructive things, I founded a Coding Association in my college for first-year rookies. As of now, students across all departmental years are members and it has been an official college club. Adding to that, I myself am a freshman. I also am an active member as an Event Organizer at Google Developers Student's Club at my college.

            So, Hello! I am currently a second-year E&TC student at PVG College of Engineering Science & Technology, Pune. You might find it difficult to spell my name. You can call me Deva, as my friends do. 
            Being a curious beaver I intend to explore Software Development. I am skilled in HTML, CSS and learning JavaScript. I have good hands on Python and C/C++.
            
            I wish you a very great day!</p>

            <p>I designed and developed a dynamic website that facilitated college students in connecting with like-minded individuals on campus.

By providing a seamless and intuitive user interface, the website fostered an environment of networking and collaboration, allowing students to engage with a diverse range of like-minded individuals and build meaningful relationships.</p>
